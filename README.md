*Adapted from [original SOC-88 repository in ds-modules](https://github.com/ds-modules/SOC-88)* 

## Labs

### Lab 1: Visualization Basics

Introduction to editing different components of a graph (titles, legends, ticks, etc.) and types of visualizations (Bar Charts, Histograms, Line Plots, Scatter Plots); illustrates differences between `datascience` and `matplotlib.pyplot` syntaxes/plots<br>
[Notebook](Intro_to_Visualizations.ipynb)

### Lab 2: Practice with Visualizations

Application of skills from Lab 1 to a larger dataset to recreate graphs from Professor Harding's *Short- and long-term effects of imprisonment on future felony convictions and prison admissions*<br>
[Notebook](Practice_with_Visualizations.ipynb)

### Lab 3: Mapping Lab 1 - Intro to Mapping w/ Folium

Introduction to mapping visualizations using `folium` library on the Police Use of Force in Minneapolis dataset along with location data on Minneapolic Neighborhoods and Police Precints; shows how to adjust & add tiles, markers, and circles to a map<br>
[Notebook](Mapping_Lab_1.ipynb)

### Lab 4: Mapping Lab 2 - Choropleth Maps

Further applications of mapping visualizations with choropleth overlays on folium maps (using the same dataset as Lab 3); quick introduction to GeoJson files to help understand logic behind syntax on creating choropleths<br>

## Homework

### HW 1: Visualizing Police Force

Utilization of visualization techniques from Labs 1 & 2 to create visualizations over the categorical and numerical data of Police Use of Force in Minneapolis<br>
[Notebook](Police_Incidents_HW.ipynb)

### HW 2: Mapping Crime in SF

Utilizations of mapping techniques from Labs 3 & 4 to illustrate specific locations of crime incidents with markers and general distribution of mental-health related incidents per each police district with choropleth overlay in San Francisco<br>
